The Malden wildfire was a tragic event which occurred on September 7, 2020 and burned more than 2,500 acres of land. This article aimed to prove that the wildfire was not influenced by climate change, and simultaneously emphasize that media outlets/politicians are exaggerating the impact of climate change. The author, *Cliff Mass*, stated three main pieces of evidence which supported his theory. His first argument was that the fire mainly burned through grass, bushes, and wheat fields, which all typically dry out during the summer and ignite easily. Secondly, the Washington State report on the fire stated that it started when a tree branch hit a transmission line, igniting the grass below. Lastly, he explained that there were strong unprecedented winds on that specific day, which was proven using climatic data from a nearby weather station. The gusts of wind from the North reached 30-50 miles per hour at their height, significantly contributing to the spread of the fire.  

His claim that the fire was not connected to climate change was only substantiated by the fact that in recent decades Malden has had hot, dry summers, and that the strong winds dried a lot of the plants in that moment, making them ideal fuel for the fire. However, he dubiously only cited data from one journal article that he published. Lastly, he attempted to explain that climate change would ultimately decrease the incidence of forest fires because warming of the inner continent would decrease atmospheric pressure and accordingly decrease the winds from the North.  

After first reading this article, I thought that he made some fair points about the ignition and the circumstantial aspects of the fire. I had automatically assumed that climate change would enhance extreme weather, therefore indirectly causing more forest fires, but I didn’t have any previous knowledge of the climate or the fire trends in that area so I began to question whether he could be right. However, upon further investigation and thoughtful questioning I have concluded that he was incorrect in claiming that climate change didn’t impact this fire event.   

In general, climate change has been proven to bring hotter and drier summers to North America, and more specifically Washington State. Wildfires depend on many factors such as temperature, soil/plant moisture, and types of vegetation present, which all have a strong connection to climate (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2020). In the Pacific Northwest of the US., historical records, current trends, and simulation modelling all indicate that climate change is causing warmer and drier summers which induce lower moisture levels and longer fire seasons (Halofsky, Peterson and Harvey, 2020). Brian Harvey, a researcher at the University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, explained that *“we can’t attribute single fire events to climate change. But the trends in large fire events that have been occurring in the region are consistent with expected trends in a warming climate”* (Hickey, 2020). In the Western US., from 1984 to 2015 the number of large fires more than doubled (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, 2020), and based on climate model projections, by the end of the 21st century the total area burned by fire each year will increase by 76-310% and the burn severity will increase by 29-41% (Rogers et al., 2011).   

This clearly shows that climate change has been and will continue to influence forest fires statistics in Washington. Even though his three main pieces of evidence seem to be true, he failed to include any general research about climate change causing intensified summer conditions or fire trends in that region. He even added that the climate would warm, and stated a mechanism in which it could reduce fires, but consciously turned a blind eye to its other effects. This is because he has a clear bias against climate change and only included information that supported his theory.
